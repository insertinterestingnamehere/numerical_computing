  abstract = {The scale-space technique introduced by Witkin involves generating
	coarser resolution images by convolving the original image with a
	Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by using the original image as the
	initial condition of a diffusion process. This approach has a major
	drawback; it is difficult to obtain accurately the locations of the
	'semantically meaningful' edges at coarse scales. In this paper we
	suggest a new definition of scale-space, and introduce a class of
	algorithms that realize it using a diffusion process. The diffusion
	coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage
	intra-region smoothing in preference to inter-region smoothing. It
	is shown that the 'No new maxima should be generated at coarse scales'
	property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region
	boundaries in our approach remain sharp, we obtain a high quality
	edge detector which successfully exploits global information. Experimental
	results are shown on a number of images. The algorithm involves simple,
	local operations replicated over the image making parallel hardware
	implementation feasible.},
