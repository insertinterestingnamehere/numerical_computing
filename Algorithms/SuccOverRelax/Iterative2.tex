\objective{Understand and code Successive Over-Relaxation}

{\bf Outline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify some potential shortcomings of Gauss-Seidel (slow convergence).
\item Introduce Successive Over-Relaxation.
\item Note that picking the relaxation constant is not necessarily easy.
\item Note necessary conditions (PSD etc.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
Code up Successive Over-Relaxation. Compare its convergence speed for several different problems. Note differences in convergence speed for different relaxation constants.
\end{problem}
