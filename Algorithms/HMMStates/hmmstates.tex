\objective{Understand how to implement forward-backward algorithm for HMM state estimation.}

Given an HMM with parameters $\lambda$ and an observation sequence $O$, we would like to answer two questions:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What is $\mathbb{P}(O | \lambda)$? In other words, what is the likelihood that our model generated the observation sequence?
 \item What is the most likely state sequence to have generated $O$, given the model $\lambda$?
\end{enumerate}
The answers to these two questions compose what is known as the \emph{forward-backward} algorithm for HMMs. For the second question, the approach taken in this lab will be to try to find the state sequence maximizing the expected number of correct states. 

We assume throughout this lab that the HMM has a discrete state space of cardinality $N$ and a discrete observation space of cardinality $M$, hence $\lambda = \left( A, B, \mathbf{\pi} \right)$ where $A$ is an $N \times N$ row-stochastic matrix, $B$ is an $N \times M$ row-stochastic matrix, and $\mathbf{\pi}$ is a stochastic vector of length $N$.

We define the \emph{forward probabilities} $\alpha_{t}(i)$ to be the joint probability of the partial observation sequence up through time $t$ and the event that the system is in state $i$ at time $t$, conditioned on the model parameters $\lambda$, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
\alpha_{t}(i) = \mathbb{P}(O_{1},\cdots,O_{t},\mathbf{x}_{t} = i | \lambda)
\end{equation*}
We also define the \emph{backward probabilities} $\beta_{t}(i)$ to be the probability of the partial observation sequence after time $t$, conditioned on the model parameters $\lambda$ and the event that the system is in state $i$ at time $t$, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
\beta_{t}(i) = \mathbb{P}(O_{t+1},\cdots,O_{T} | \mathbf{x}_{t} = i, \lambda)
\end{equation*}


The forward probabilities $\alpha_{t}(i)$ can be computed recursively as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\alpha_{1}(i) = \pi_{i}b_{iO_{1}}$
 \item $\alpha_{t}(i) = \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{N} \alpha_{t-1}(j)a_{ji}\right] b_{iO_{t}}$ for $t = 2,\cdots,T.$
\end{itemize}

The backward probabilities $\beta_{t}(i)$ can be computed recursively as well, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\beta_{T}(i) = 1$
 \item $\beta_{t}(i) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij}b_{jO_{t+1}}\beta_{t+1}(j)$ for $t = T-1, \cdots, 1$.
\end{itemize}
Unfortunately, this is then subject to serious underflow issues, since we are repeatedly multiplying together numbers between $0$ and $1$. We modify the forward pass as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\tilde{\alpha}_{1}(i) = \pi_{i} b_{iO_{1}}$
 \item $\sigma_{1} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \tilde{\alpha}_{1}(i)}$
 \item $\widehat{\alpha}_{1}(i) = \tilde{\alpha}_{1}(i) \sigma_{1}$
 \item For $t = 2, \cdots, T$,
 \begin{itemize}
	 \item $\tilde{\alpha}_{t}(i) = \left[ \sum_{j=1}^{N} \widehat{\alpha}_{t-1}(j)a_{ji}\right] b_{iO_{t}}$ for $t = 2,\cdots,T.$
	 \item $\sigma_{t} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \tilde{\alpha}_{t}(i)}$
	 \item $\widehat{\alpha}_{t}(i) = \tilde{\alpha}_{t}(i) \sigma_{t}$
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
Write a function that will compute the modified forward pass, given model parameters $\lambda$ and observation sequence $O$. It should return a $T \times N$ matrix $\widehat{\alpha}$ and an array $\sigma$ of length $T$.
\end{problem}

We also need to modify the backward pass:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\widehat{\beta}_{T}(i) = \sigma_{T}$
 \item $\widehat{\beta}_{t}(i) = \sigma_{t} \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{ij}b_{jO_{t+1}}\widehat{\beta}_{t+1}(j)$ for $t = T-1, \cdots, 1$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
Write a function that will compute the modified backward pass, given model parameters $\lambda$ and observation sequence $O$. It should return a $T \times N$ matrix $\widehat{\beta}$.
\end{problem}

It turns out that the way in which we have scaled our probabilities yields an efficient way to compute the log-likelihood of $O$, given $\lambda$, namely
$$\log \mathbb{P}(O | \lambda) = - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \log \sigma_{t}.$$

\begin{problem}
Pickle in the observations and the HMM parameters contained in the files `observations' and `hmm' respectively. The file `hmm' is a list $\left[ A, \; B, \; \mathbf{\pi}, \; obs\_space \right]$ where $obs\_space$ denotes the observation space for the model. Compute the log-likelihood of the data given the model. The observations come from the observation space
\begin{verbatim}
('Clean', 'Run', 'Work')
\end{verbatim}
so you may need to make an appropriate transformation of the observation sequence to work with your previous functions. Note that `Clean' corresponds with the first column of the observation matrix in the HMM, `Run' with the second observation, and `Work' with the third.
\end{problem}

It also turns out that 
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{P}(\mathbf{x}_{t} = i | O, \lambda) = \frac{\widehat{\alpha}_{t}(i)\widehat{\beta}_{t}(i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \widehat{\alpha}_{t}(j)\widehat{\beta}_{t}(j)}
\end{equation*}
and so we can easily compute the expected state at time $t$ by
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{x}_{t}^{*} = \argmax_{i} \widehat{\alpha}_{t}(i) \widehat{\beta}_{t}(i)
\end{equation*}
We refer to the above probability as $\gamma_{t}(i)$.

\begin{problem}
Using the same observations and HMM parameters, maximize the expected number of correct states. Pickle in the true states from the file `states', and write a function to compute the error rate in your state estimations. This should simply be the number of states incorrectly estimated divided by the total number of time iterations $T$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Write a function that accepts $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and returns a $T \times N$ matrix of state probabilities $\gamma$.
\end{problem}
