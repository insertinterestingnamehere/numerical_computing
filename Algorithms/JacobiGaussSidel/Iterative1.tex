\objective{Understand and code two basic iterative methods}

{\bf Outline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain that Factorization methods are very effective for solving linear equations, but they can be too slow for very large scale problems.
\item Explain that we can instead use iterative methods to approximate solutions for very large systems.
\item Introduce Mechanics of Jacobi Method and Gauss-Seidel
\item Note conditions for convergence (PSD, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
Code up Jacobi Method and Gauss-Seidel. Compare performance for larger problem with a least squares approach.
