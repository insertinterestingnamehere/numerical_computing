\begin{problem}
Find the sum of the first four billion odd Fibonacci numbers that are divisible by 3.
\end{problem}


Python generators produce values of a sequence on demand.  When iterating over a large
sequence, generators a much more efficient.

\section*{Combinations}
Combinations are subsets of a set.  The powerset of a set, $S$, is the set of all combinations
of elements in $S$.  The cardinality of the the powerset is $2^{\abs{A}}$.  Clearly, if our
set is of any appreciable size, the powerset will much larger.  Let's look at one method for
generating the powerset of a set.

We can generate the powerset of a set by representing each element in a set by one bit.
If the bit is 0, then we do not include the element in the current combination.  If the
bit is 1, the element is included in the combination.  Then we count from 0 to $2^{\abs{A}}$
and look as the binary representation of the number, including or excluding elements based
on the bits in their respective location.

\begin{problem}
Write a function that will accept a set of elements and return a list of all the combinations
of elements of that set.  You will have to impose some sort of ordering on the set (map each element
in the set to a position in the binary representation).
\end{problem}


Use combinations to find all factors of n
